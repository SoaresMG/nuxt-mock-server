features:
  - icon: 🛠️
    title: Full SSR Seamless experience
    details: This module does not act on the client/browser, instead it's the routes that are mocked, just like if they were permanently and timelessly cached
  - icon: 🛠️
    title: Auto / Selective mode
    details: Automatically identify routes based on a RegExp or simply use the selective mode where the developer has full control on which routes are to be considered.
  - icon: 🛠️
    title: DevTools Support
    details: With the Mock Server tab on Nuxt's devtools you will never loose track of which group of mocks (Presets) you are looking at.
  - icon: 🛠️
    title: Composable-first approach
    details: Composables that allow developers to ignore the default behaviour of nuxt-mock-server and instead dictate where, what and when the mocking actions will be taken.
